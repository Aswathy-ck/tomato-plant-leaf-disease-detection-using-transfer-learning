### üçÖ Tomato Plant Leaf Disease Detection using Transfer Learning

This project detects diseases in tomato plant leaves using a deep learning model (DenseNet121). The web application is built with Flask and allows users to upload a leaf image, which is then classified into one of several tomato plant disease classes. The app also provides a Grad-CAM visualization to show which part of the image influenced the prediction.

### ‚ú® Features

- Upload tomato leaf images via browser
- Predict disease using a pre-trained DenseNet121 model
- Provides visual explanation using Grad-CAM
- Clean and simple Flask web interface

### üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Flask
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV
- Grad-CAM
- HTML, CSS
